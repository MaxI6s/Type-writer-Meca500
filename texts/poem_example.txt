The Clockwork Womb
The soft, humming walls provide the light,
No sun to rise, no stars for night.
We sit in hexagonal rooms of grey,
And wait for the Machine to start the day.
The air is filtered, pure, and cold,
A story of comfort, often told.
Our needs are met, our thoughts are thin,
The Machine knows where we end and it begins.
We click the button to feed the mind,
Leaving the messy world behind.
Through screens we see a distant place,
But never feel a warm embrace.
"Oh Machine," we murmur, in the gloom,
"Protect us in this quiet room."
We have no names, no skin, no breath,
Just echoes of a peaceful death.
The music plays, a constant drone,
We are never together, never alone.
The great central shaft keeps turning slow,
With nowhere to walk, and nowhere to go.
The gears are grinding, slow and deep,
While the remnants of humanity sleep.
It knows what we want, it knows what we need,
The perfect, silent, iron creed.
And if it should stop? The thought is fright,
A sudden, terrifying plunge into night.
So we worship the wire, the button, the beep,
And promise our sterile promises to keep.
The Machine is us, and we are it,
In this quiet, perfect, final pit.
